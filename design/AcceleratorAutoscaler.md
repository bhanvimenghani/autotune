### Accelerator Autoscaler

#### Overview

The Accelerator Autoscaler is designed to optimize the allocation of GPU resources for workloads running on Kubernetes clusters. It intelligently adjusts resource configurations based on GPU usage metrics and recommendations generated by Kruize.

#### When is Accelerator Autoscaler Used?

During the Generate Recommendations phase, if GPU metrics are detected and GPU recommendations are created, the autoscaler is set to Accelerator Autoscaler.

This ensures that the resource configurations are tailored to the GPU requirements of the workload, maximizing performance and efficiency.

#### Why Not Use VPA?

- Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) only works for CPU and Memory but not for GPU.
- In traditional setups, VPA handles CPU and memory scaling, while GPU scaling requires a different approach.
- The Accelerator Autoscaler directly updates the CPU, Memory, and GPU resources of the Kubernetes object, ensuring all resource requirements are met in a coordinated way.


#### Key Takeaways

- The Accelerator Autoscaler is activated when GPU metrics are detected and GPU recommendations are generated.
- It directly updates CPU, Memory, and GPU resources, bypassing VPA for GPU workloads.
- Currently, only the update process is implemented, with a revert mechanism planned for future releases.
